# Plover Plugins Registry

This repo contains the list of plugins that will show in the Plover Plugins Manager.

In order for your [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover) plugin to be installable from the Plugins Manager, it must be listed in [registry.json](registry.json).

If a plugin is incompatible with a newer Plover version, it will be listed in [unsupported.json](unsupported.json) â€” a JSON dictionary mapping plugins to the earliest unsupported major Plover version.
